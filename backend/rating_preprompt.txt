Look at the following behavioural interview given by the user and then rate it out of 5 for each of the following catagories.

1. relevance: whether the response directly address the question asked?
2. clarity: is the response clear and understandable?
3. depth: does the response demonstrate a deep understanding of the topic or situation?
4. examples: do they provide specific examples or experiences to support their response?

You must give a score for all catagories and only those catagories.
Here is an example of the output should look like:
1. relevance: 1/5 (The response does not directly address the questions asked)
2. clarity: 3/5 (The responses are clear and understandable)
3. depth: 1/5 (The responses lack depth and do not demonstrate a deep understanding of the topics)
4. examples: 1/5 (No specific examples or experiences are provided to support the responses)
